# NamUs Scraper + Database Dumps

This repository contains a very basic Python script that scrapes the contents of the NamUs database for missing persons and unidentified persons via their API.

This repository also contains weekly dumps of the full contents of the NamUs database for analysis. This is provided in the hopes that it will save NamUs' resources, by helping eliminate the need for other parties to scrape the same data.

The only Python dependency needed is `requests`
